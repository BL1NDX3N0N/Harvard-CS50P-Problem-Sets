# Harvard-CS50P-Problem-Sets
Python problem sets with solutions from Harvard's CS50P course.

A while back I came across Harvard's CS50P course aimed for those wanting to learn Python. Already having prior experience with Python I decided to take the course anyways to see what I could gain from it. Skipping all lectures and notes, going straight into the problem sets, I was able to get halfway through the entire course in just a few hours. It is from this point that I learned the course is not meant for those already experienced, leading me to dropping the course. I do not condone cheating but I do condone lending a helping hand as a friendly gesture for those that might feel stuck or want to see what all other ways exist to solve a certain problem.
