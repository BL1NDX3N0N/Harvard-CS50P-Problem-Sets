# Outdated

In the United States, dates are typically formatted in [month-day-year order](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Date_and_time_notation_in_the_United_States) (MM/DD/YYYY), otherwise known as[ middle-endian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endianness#Middle-endian) order, which is arguably bad design. Dates in that format can’t be easily sorted because the date’s year comes last instead of first. Try sorting, for instance, `2/2/1800`, `3/3/1900`, and `1/1/2000` chronologically in any program (e.g., a spreadsheet). Dates in that format are also ambiguous. Harvard was [founded](https://www.harvard.edu/about/history/) on September 8, 1636, but 9/8/1636 could also be interpreted as August 9, 1636!

Fortunately, computers tend to use [ISO 8601](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_8601), an international standard that prescribes that dates should be formatted in year-month-day (YYYY-MM-DD) order, no matter the country, formatting years with four digits, months with two digits, and days with two digits, “padding” each with leading zeroes as needed.

In a file called `outdated.py`, implement a program that prompts the user for a date, [anno Domini](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anno_Domini), in month-day-year order, formatted like `9/8/1636` or `September 8, 1636`, wherein the month in the latter might be any of the values in the `list` below:

``` Py
[
    "January",
    "February",
    "March",
    "April",
    "May",
    "June",
    "July",
    "August",
    "September",
    "October",
    "November",
    "December"
]
```

Then output that same date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format. If the user’s input is not a valid date in either format, prompt the user again. Assume that every month has no more than 31 days; no need to validate whether a month has 28, 29, 30, or 31 days.
