# Felipe’s Taqueria

One of the most popular places to eat in [Harvard Square](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harvard_Square) is [Felipe’s Taqueria](https://www.felipesboston.com/), which offers a [menu](https://www.felipesboston.com/menu) of entrees, per the `dict` below, wherein the value of each key is a price in dollars:

``` Py
{
    "Baja Taco": 4.00,
    "Burrito": 7.50,
    "Bowl": 8.50,
    "Nachos": 11.00,
    "Quesadilla": 8.50,
    "Super Burrito": 8.50,
    "Super Quesadilla": 9.50,
    "Taco": 3.00,
    "Tortilla Salad": 8.00
}
```

In a file called `taqueria.py`, implement a program that enables a user to place an order, prompting them for items, one per line, until the user inputs control-d (which is a common way of ending one’s input to a program). After each inputted item, display the total cost of all items inputted thus far, prefixed with a dollar sign (`$`) and formatted to two decimal places. Treat the user’s input case insensitively. Ignore any input that isn’t an item. Assume that every item on the menu will be [titlecased](https://docs.python.org/3/library/stdtypes.html#str.title).
